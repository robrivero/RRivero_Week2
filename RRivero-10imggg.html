<p>In the Western Conference, Curry (1,369,658) has passed teammate Kevin Durant (1,326,059) to become the leading vote-getter.  Curry, the Houston Rockets’ James Harden (978,540) and the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook (791,332) continue to be the top three guards in the West.

Durant maintains the top spot in the West frontcourt.  The New Orleans Pelicans’ Anthony Davis (664,687) remains in second place, while Golden State’s Draymond Green (616,730) has moved ahead of New Orleans’ DeMarcus Cousins (587,835) for third place.</p>

<p>Under a new All-Star Game format that replaces the traditional matchup between conferences, two captains will choose the rosters from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves.  The captains will be the All-Star starter from each conference who receives the most fan votes in his conference.</p>

<p>Gone is the traditional East-versus-West format that had been used since 1951, replaced by a draft in which the top two vote-getters act as captains and select their teams from a pool of All-Stars. Which means we could see LeBron James and James Harden on the same team, or Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry sharing a backcourt.
The pool of All-Stars will be picked in the way we're used to seeing. Fans, players and media will vote for the starters -- two guards and three frontcourt players from each conference -- and coaches will choose the reserves.

Those coach's picks are great for never-been All-Stars who are looking to become first-time All-Stars.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference backcourt is crowded with a half-dozen other players warranting serious consideration. Lowry remains as impactful as ever and DeRozan is having another DeRozan-esque season. He’s a three-time all-star and that will carry weight with coaches. Beal is close to his first nod and so is Ben Simmons, who is the only rookie with a legit shot of being selected. We’ll need to make room for John Wall once he gets a few more games under his belt and Kemba Walker is trying mightily to keep the sinking Hornets afloat. Good players will be left home. But not RUSSELL WESTBROOK</p>

<p>All voting ends tonight, Monday, Jan. 15 at 11:59 p.m. ET. As of last Thursday, when the latest ballots were announced, Antetokounmpo trailed James, 1,480,954 to 1,622,838. That's a difference of only 141,884 votes, and considering the near-endless opportunity to vote, the Bucks are stumping hard on social media for their beloved superstar, hoping Antetokounmpo's large international following and Milwaukee's devoted local fan base can propel a late, come-from-behind win.</p>
